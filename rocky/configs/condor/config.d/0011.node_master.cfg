### Node Master
### --------------------
### This should be used by central nodes (negotiator, collector, schedd)

# Nodes should update more frequently than the rest; they are IMPORTANT!
MASTER_UPDATE_INTERVAL = 30

### IPv6 handling
ENABLE_IPv6            = FALSE
# can replaced by condor_version > 8.5.6 with
#PREFER_IPv4            = TRUE
